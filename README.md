# Stacja_analiza
It is an analytical project that I performed for a petrol station in Poland in 2020.
As an input file I get PDF (Historia_nalan.pdf).
The source file contains transactions from all 14 fuel distributors concluded in one day.
This project was a prototype and the aim was to show the station manager what information
can be extracted from files like Historia_nalan.pdf. The final results of the prototype were presented in the file Report.html

Unfortunately, I couldn't develop the project further because of management changes at petrol station

## Analytical steps
To get an outcome from the pdf source file, the following steps were performed in R language:
1. Data were loaded to R program from PDF.
2. Data were cleaned  to crate clear table.
3. Data were visualized on different plots so that the manager could choose the best option.
4. A report was created.
